Very relieved and pleased!</p>\n<p>NOTE: still need to do some minor work to get the blinker LED light to work when left-hand turning (right-hand turn works) and the &#8220;neutral light&#8221; wasn&#8217;t working (poop!) so will try to solve both next time I crack into the headlight birdnest of cables and post here how I fixed it (have some good leads over at hondatwins.net for the blinker minor issue&#8230;)</p>\n",
