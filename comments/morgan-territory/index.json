    "body": "<p>We had 12 riders start and finish this challenging and beautiful course!   Thank you all for coming and for RSVP-ing!  It started out a bit cool (but not tooo bad).   The bulk of the riders wound up missing the turn off the bike path towards Clayton but thankfully managed to reloop back (after unfortunately adding on 6 miles to their day!)  The group came back together in Clayton so we could start the climb together.  After the long climb and descent we hit an average amount of headwind and crosswind returning to Danville (it can be *really* bad sometimes).  Once in Danville, we all ate a lot, soaked up the sun and heat, and then finished the final 15 miles.   Yay for everyone making it through it!  I&#8217;m so happy we all got to share this little secret gem together!</p>\n",

It was a longer and tougher ride than they were used to and it&#8217;s possible food and electrolytes may have added to that.  They rallied after large late lunches (with bananas and electrolyte drinks!) in Danville and were able to avoid bailing out early.  A+ for persistence and effort!</p>\n",
