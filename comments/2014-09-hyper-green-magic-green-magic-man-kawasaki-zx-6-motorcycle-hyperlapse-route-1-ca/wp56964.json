    "body": "<p>hi Kelly and Keeper,</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m very sorry to say that I think, after looking around web and checking with Green Magic Man, that the forum is sadly just plain gone.  That is pretty horrific/terrible, I&#8217;m a little stunned.   As an Archivist (major programmer at archive.org) this saddens me greatly.  You can still find some of our crawled versions of some of the pages here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://zx6e.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://zx6e.net</a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really a shame &#8212; if they gave members some notice, we would have happily crawled it to the bottom and made sure it got saved in our archives fully&#8230;</p>\n",
