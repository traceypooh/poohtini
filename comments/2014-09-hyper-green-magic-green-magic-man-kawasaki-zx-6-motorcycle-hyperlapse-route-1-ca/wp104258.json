I&#8217;m looking at starting up a new website to pick up where zx6e.net left off&#8230;I have a lot of the stickies and valuable information that I had saved over the years. I wanted to avoid a duplication of effort&#8230;hence why I&#8217;m asking whether this project ever got off the ground. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Justin</p>\n",
