But I&#8217;m really posting this comment to get in touch, because I think I knew you at CU, where I worked for Bruce and Dan.  I had a different name then, and looked different, though!  We took a motorcycle ride together once, but that was before you had a license, I think.  I had a CBR600.  Drop me an email sometime!</p>\n",
