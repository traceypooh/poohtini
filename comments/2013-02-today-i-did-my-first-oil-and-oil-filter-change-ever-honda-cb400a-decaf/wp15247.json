    "body": "<p>Hi June,<br />\nhehe, awesome to hear!  I grew up in NH, so it&#8217;s a trip to think of you potentially riding down the same roads and scenes as I would have &#8212; but with our shared bike \ud83d\ude0e<br />\nGlad you like the mods &#8212; all were done by the prior owner, except the total consolidation, cleanup, and replacement of all the instruments and area (speedo, neutral and directional indicators and other lights, etc.)  (which is quite easy to do if you ever get the inkling \ud83d\ude09<br />\nMy boyfriend&#8217;s Harley got waaaay less attention too, and he had really styled it and nearly &#8220;murdered&#8221; it, too.  It&#8217;s nice to get the kudos from people who see the bike and it takes them back to their Honda CB from 30+ years ago, isn&#8217;t it?<br />\n(And it&#8217;s very nice to feel like we are stewards of some true Antiques that have quite the heritage and history, too).</p>\n<p>And yes, I&#8217;m sure you can get as much attention as you&#8217;d care for, with the fans that attract to your bike.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for the comment and thoughts &#8212; always appreciated to connect with another kindred rider &#8212; and another kindred sister!</p>\n",
