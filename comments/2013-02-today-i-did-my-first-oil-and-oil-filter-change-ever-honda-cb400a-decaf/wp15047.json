    "body": "<p>Hi Tracy,   I have the same motorcycle here in NH!   1978 CB400A.   I love the cafe racer style of your bike.   Very nice work.   Mine sat in my friends shop for many years, then he decided to get it going for me.   It has the original seat and mostly original parts.   I love that bike and soooo many people want to talk to me about it.   My husband&#8217;s boring Harley gets no attention, but there is always a fan club around my bike.   I joke with my husband that if I want to meet men, I just need to travel around on that bike!  I hope you are still riding her and that she lasts for many more years.</p>\n",
