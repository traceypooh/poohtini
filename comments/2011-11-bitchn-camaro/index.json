That rear cam is great &#8212; I still have a hard time not wanting to swing around and look and put my right arm across the seatback when in reverse.  \ud83d\ude0e</p>\n<p>I know what you mean about the Mercs and Beemers &#8212; Hunter (boyfriend) has a Beemer 3-series wagon.  I like it a lot and it has the sport package so it *is* very very quick feeling and &#8220;twitchy&#8221; &#8212; but BM/Merc/Audi (to me) just have gotten to be a bit &#8220;expected&#8221; in looks compared to years past and just dont quite have close to that raw oozing interest and looks of the camaro!  And cheaper, too!</p>\n<p>The waiting will be difficult but I think it will be worth it.  What colors did you settle on?  I think you are getting the V-8 version, right?</p>\n<p>Best regards from across the pond,<br />\n-tracey</p>\n<p>I can imagine the wait is going to be</p>\n",
