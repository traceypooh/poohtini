    "body": "<p>hi there!<br />\npersonally, I loved it.  If you get a decent candidate one (look for oil leaks or signs of it especially and check all electrical would be my advice) they are pretty rock-solid and _very_ simple &#8212; both great things.</p>\n<p>So when we blew one of the three main gaskets (due to oil too full, age, and running hard on highway on a blistering hot day &#8212; bad recipe!) and took the engine apart, we found that the insides literally looked close to new (jaws hit floor).  We had some carbon buildup on the piston heads (expected) and cleaned them and replace the piston rings (pretty standard practice) but the transmission below and all the rest seemed super solid.  Look for rust too &#8212; just in terms of indicators of how it was cared for and body/parts integrity.</p>\n<p>I  _did_ find every once in awhile, esp. taking off from a stop sign on hard left/right, gunning reasonably hard, the footshift gear up could slip (which was jarring) but that might have just been my bike.  I dont think &#8220;automatic transmissions&#8221; (this is basically a two gear version of it) are expected to last 40+ years so maybe that&#8217;s something to just be aware of.</p>\n<p>Bikes this old will have little problems here and there.  In the case of old carbureted single or dual cylinder bikes, though, they are so simple that most issues can be traced back and sorted.  They dont have high tech computers in them regulating, and electrical issues can be sorted out.  </p>\n<p>Hope that&#8217;s helpful &#8212; sorry for the delay!</p>\n<p>Keep on riding and most importantly stay &#8220;up&#8221; and safe out there!</p>\n",
