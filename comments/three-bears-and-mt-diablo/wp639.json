    "body": "<p>We *did* it!<br />\nAfter Tracey&#8217;s bike-on-bike collision last week, I was amazed to be able to complete the entire ride, leading it with Hunter.</p>\n<p>We rode with 21 riders total &#8212; our biggest group ride yet!  It started cold, foggy, *very* windy, and 49 degrees!  At the top of Diablo it was 85 degrees and blazing sun.  What a day!</p>\n<p>A small number of riders only went up to the halfway point.  The rest made it up and down safely, phew!   Everyone was able to keep a decent pace and everyone had good experience climbing hills on bikes!</p>\n",
