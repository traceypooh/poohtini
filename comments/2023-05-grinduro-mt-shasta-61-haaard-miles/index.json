First off -- HUGE CONGRATS FOR PODIUM #1!!\n\nWow, so glad Jennifer mentioned you!   I had remembered from our days working together that she had a sister who was a \"bike nut\" and racing :)     After being a weekly rider for most of my life, we finally found gravel biking about 18 months ago and have been hooked ever since, biking almost every day now, averaging ~2hrs/daily (!)\n\nWhat a fun and challenging 60+ miles.   Hope to meet up with you sometime in the future and who knows, maybe a podium!  :D","date":"2023-05-27T00:37:39.373Z"}
