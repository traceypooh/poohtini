    "body": "<p>Hi Tracey,</p>\n<p>How are you?  We met at Demuxed last year.</p>\n<p>I wanted to invite you to join me for an event I&#8217;m organizing the day after Demuxed, focused on the future decentralized video technology. The event is for video engineers building or interested in decentralized video infrastructure and applications. We&#8217;re curating the guest list and limiting it to 30 engineers in the space, and I think your perspective and experience would be hugely valuable. Through a series of informal break-outs and lightning talks, you&#8217;ll walk away with clear examples of how decentralization is shifting the paradigm of video tech, along with an understanding of challenges ahead. </p>\n<p> Please save the date and RSVP (<a href=\"https://videoandblockchainunconference.splashthat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://videoandblockchainunconference.splashthat.com/</a>)<br />\nFriday, October 19th<br />\n10 am &#8211; 5 pm<br />\nSoma, San Francisco </p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to see you there.</p>\n<p>Best,<br />\nEric Tang<br />\nCTO @ Livepeer</p>\n",
