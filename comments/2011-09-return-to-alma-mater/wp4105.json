    "body": "<p>Great pic and so nice to read the notes on your visit. I was there for a memorial service for Engineering prof. and Ombudsman Walter Lynn a few weeks ago. Spent most of the time on campus in WSH Memorial Room and terrace. I totally know what you mean about your brain just snapping right back into Cornell mode. </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t know if you got a chance to see, but the new Architecture building where Rand Hall and SIbley used to be&#8211;which might now be re-named&#8211;is gorgeous. Ditto a small box outside the Johnson Museum that reportedly goes down nine floors or something. Cool to see the new stuff, comforting to recognize the old stuff. </p>\n<p>Thanks for sharing, Tracey.</p>\n",
