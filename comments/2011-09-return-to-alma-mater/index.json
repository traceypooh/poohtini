    "body": "<p>Great pic and so nice to read the notes on your visit. I was there for a memorial service for Engineering prof. and Ombudsman Walter Lynn a few weeks ago. Spent most of the time on campus in WSH Memorial Room and terrace. I totally know what you mean about your brain just snapping right back into Cornell mode. </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t know if you got a chance to see, but the new Architecture building where Rand Hall and SIbley used to be&#8211;which might now be re-named&#8211;is gorgeous. Ditto a small box outside the Johnson Museum that reportedly goes down nine floors or something. Cool to see the new stuff, comforting to recognize the old stuff. </p>\n<p>Thanks for sharing, Tracey.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>yay!  yah, I did get to see the new architecture bldng and it is *fantastic*/amazing, love it!!  it was at the very top of my list to hit on foot (after car tour of the new) but I got slightly lost after hitting CIT to restore my netID and thought I remembered it near the Johnson (ironically I wandered thru the older Sibley/Rand and saw the impressive 9/11 related exhibit (including kind of jaw-dropping &#8220;Nuke York&#8221; &#8212; did you see that?!) but managed to miss it as I ran out of time.  Next visit, for sure!</p>\n<p>What an amazing place.  Really took me back (and to be honest made me wish I had mentally entertained Architecture as a major at least to explore it (Psychology became my &#8220;backup plan&#8221; when I wasn&#8217;t sure I&#8217;d be able to &#8220;make it&#8221; in Engineering&#8217;s rigorous and highly theoretical Comp Sci.!  8-))</p>\n<p>How cool would it be if you, me, and Kolin Ohi all made it back at the same time, huh?</p>\n<p>hugs!<br />\n-trace</p>\n",
