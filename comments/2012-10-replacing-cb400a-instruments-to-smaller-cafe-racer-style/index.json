    "body": "<p>Thanks, Therod!</p>\n<p>heh, I was putting the bolts in groups on a piece of paper and writing up where came from.  After many piles, I looked around garage for old buttercups or something and found these silly ice cube trays we couldn&#8217;t *give away* and thought Perfect!  \ud83d\ude0e</p>\n<p>glad you liked the idea/progress.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll make sure to post more pics/progress as I go.  I just ordered the speedo and took apart the front light to find the wiring harness connector for the ignition (turns out it&#8217;s a 6-wire rectangular plastic connector for the closest OEM part (which Dime City unfortunately didn&#8217;t carry).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll tag everything related where it can be found here&#8230;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://poohBot.com/tags/decaf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://poohBot.com/tags/decaf/</a></p>\n",
