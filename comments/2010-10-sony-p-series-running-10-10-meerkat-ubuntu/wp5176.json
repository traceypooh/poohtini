    "body": "<p>hi matt,<br />\nah, thanks for that.  i think sometimes my older wordpress base would mangle/shorten links in some baffling ways &#8212; i&#8217;ve corrected it, thanks for that!</p>\n<p>glad you found this useful.  ironically, now, i got an iPad2 for my birthday and have &#8220;kitted&#8221; it out with iSSH app and a bluetooth keyboard so it&#8217;s now becoming my mini travel machine (so I&#8217;m actually going to sell my VAIO P-Series! 8-p)<br />\nbut I was still delighted to get a non-windoze OS on the little great Sony *and* to get video acceleration to work &#8212; seeing 720p HD h.264 video play on it is pretty mindblowing!</p>\n",
