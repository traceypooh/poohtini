We had 7 riders join us for a perfect sized storming of these 45 miles.  2 of the riders (one was another Training Ride Leader incognito) *whipped* though the course and finished a stunning 90 minutes before the rest of us.</p>\n<p>Hunter and I each got a flat, at separate times, so we both wound up by the end being the sweeps.  That was just fine since everyone made it though the entire route and everyone kept safe, phew!</p>\n<p>Yay surreal climbing routes.  I was really happy that a bunch of you commented to me how you enjoyed the strange sites and choice of the course!</p>\n<p>Roll on!</p>\n",
