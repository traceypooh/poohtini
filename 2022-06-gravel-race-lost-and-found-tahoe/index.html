[One Gravel Race](https://lostandfoundbikeride.com/); Two nights camping; 62 miles.  OMG I just biked my longest off-road ever -- by a long shot!  (This is also my first bike race ever).

I just had an *incredibly* proud and rewarding "race" with my gravel bike, Candy.  Hunter and his "Thirsty Thursday" weekly riding friends signed up for this tough, mostly off-road race, in the Sierra mountains, just north of Tahoe.

Hunter encouraged me to join them and try the 35 mile easiest option.  I had _just_ done a tough 33 mile mostly off-road "Dirty Zoo" east bay ride with 4500 feet of climbing, to train up, the weekend before.

However, Hunter and all his friends were doing the 60 mile option -- and the day of registration, last minute I decided to try to push myself _really_ hard and see if I could do the 60 mile option.  Rationale?  It was less than ~500 feet more of climbing than my training weekend trip.  I knew I could _likely_ do another 10 miles -- so if I made 45 miles or more, I'd be super happy.

Well, by hitting every rest stop, eating and drinking _tons_, and gracefully perfect weather (I blow up in hot sun rides), I *MADE EVERY MILE!*.

_Most_ of the climbing is at the start -- if you can keep your heartrate decent, not push toooo hard at the start (and not "blow up") -- you can likely finish the ride (if you keep eating/drinking).

Hunter & I starting out.  The 100 mile option left one hour before us.  We get a Police escort on pavement for the first few miles, then take a right turn, and _SHOWTIME_ -- it's time to climb 1800+ feet, off road.

Hunter & I agreed to do our own pace and text each other at each rest stop.  Lake Davis in bacgkround.

I can't believe that at this point, I'm _pretty sure_ I'm going to make it.

The wildflowers, sunflowers, and green were so beautiful to ride through.

It was a super-emotional finish line for me!  I expected that Hunter and friends were all back at camp.  After taking pictures and not *really* racing, I noted if I pushed it the final 10 miles, I *might* make it within *one hour* of Hunter's total time.  I pushed *super hard* the final mile into the finish line.  I was already crying before I hit the line -- I couldn't believe I did something this long and challenging, without nearly enough long-distance rides to train up for this.

When I saw Hunter and our friends at the finish, whooping it up for my hot rush into the line, it was _such_ an amazing feeling.  Hunter and I were both crying. :)

Here's my stats.  9.2 mph overall clock average from the 9am start -- this _vastly exceeded_ my hopes.  I thought I was going to get caught up by the "sweeps" for going too slow and taken off the course.  Six and a half hours for 62 miles is _really good_ -- I'm super proud!

Here's our campsite, right next to a river, about 8 of us.
