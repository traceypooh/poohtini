This is a great and pretty country classic!
We tour the mostly flat canyons first east and then south from Orinda.

We start hitting some pretty rural countryside, parks, and even go by some vineyards.
We stop in the &"town that time forgot" teeny railroad town of Sunol.
We head to the main climb after that,
the nearly continuous (but never toooo steep) "get in your zone" climb through the sheltered
(from weather, cars, everything!) Palomares canyon,
passing some wineries and some houses built for gnomes.

After the climb, we take a break, descend into Castro Valley,
then wind our way back through the hilly reservoirs and back to Orinda.
This one feels epic for a reason -- we basically bike to Fremont border and back!
