My favorite trip ever!  I surprised Hunter for our 20th anniversary together, with a week vacation to Kauai - one of my top five favorite places in the world!  Beaches, waterfalls, flying planes & jeeps -- the sweet life!

![surprise card](../img/kauai01.jpg)

Here's the surprise card I had him open -- with only 36 hours to the flight [grin].

I had secretly cleared it with his boss to take the week off. üòª

## Day one

![arriving with jeep rental](../img/kauai02.jpg)

We've been thinking about a Jeep, so I rented us nearly the exact model we were thinking of from Turo for the week.  We spent the first 4 nights in the mellow town of Kapa'a at a cool place that had cats all over the property, and a garage of basic bikes we could use anytime.

Our first night!  Celebrating with fantastic margaritas and mexican downtown.

## Day two - Let's go topless!

![jeep back top removal](../img/kauai06.jpg)

The rental guy was so nice -- he even helped us take the top off at his shop.  Hunter got the front panels off, then the back, and finally all four doors (and gulp, side mirrors, too).

![driving the coast, topless](../img/kauai07.jpg)

We headed off for two adventures.  First, Waimea Canyon (the "Grand Canyon" of Hawaii).

![hunter standing in jeep](../img/kauai08.jpg)

It's so fun with everything off.  With all the parts left 1-2 hours of driving at the shop, we're hoping for a rainless day. üòù

![hunter & tracey waimea canyon overlook](../img/kauai09.jpg)

The canyon is just gorgeous.  I absolutely want to hike it some day.

![driving dirt road](../img/kauai10.jpg)

Next, we're continuing on clockwise to the northwest end of the island.  There is a 4x4 only beach at the end with our name on it :)

![driving dirt road with no doors](../img/kauai11.jpg)

The payoff at the beach with the views is great.  We wandered around the beach until near sunset and shared a beer.

![hunter and jeep at the beach](../img/kauai12.jpg)

I just love how the jeep looks with everything off. üòª

## Day three - The Secret Falls

![paddling kayak upriver](../img/kauai14.jpg)

The airbnb host told us when we checked in about a cool option that I **immediately** wanted for us.
Basically, if we got up super early, he'd drop us off with a 2-person kayak at a river to the south of Kapa'a.  **Like a treasure map** the only instructions were **perfectly** vague.  Paddle up about 30-60 minutes, pass a historical village on the right, and then take a small river fork off to right.
Go upstream, beach the boat, then follow a trail for ~45 minutes to a secret falls.

![tracey & hunter kayaking](../img/kauai15.jpg)

Total adventure - I'm giddy beyond belief.

![kayak in river with clouds](../img/kauai16.jpg)

The scenery is just jaw-droppingly beautiful.

![tracey & hunter beaching the kayak](../img/kauai17.jpg)

We think we found the place to park the boat!

![hunter & tracey crossing stream of mini waterfall](../img/kauai18.jpg)

Hiking through the jungle, crossing stream inlets, following the main fork to our right.

![secret falls through the forest](../img/kauai19.jpg)

OMG!  Our guide was right!  We made it -- and we're the first visitors of the day.  It's all ours!

![tracey about to dip into the falls](../img/kauai20.jpg)

![hunter with arms raised in the falls](../img/kauai21.jpg)

We're so happy!

![tracey & hunter at waterfall bottom](../img/kauai22.jpg)

Hunter brought a gopro waterproof camera, so we got to take a bunch of pictures and video and kiss under the falls. ü•∞

## Day four - low key

![kauai beach](../img/kauai23.jpg)

We did some biking, some great asian fusion food.  At sunset most nights, we'd bike or drive to a beach and have a beer in the sand with some cheese & crackers.

## Day five - up up and away!

![pilot & hunter taxiiing airport runway](../img/kauai24.jpg)

Hunter's getting his pilot's license!  We called around and one of tourist plane rentals would **totally** let him be copilot for the same fee.  (Normally you have to rent a plane and fuel, plus instructor fees...)  Turns out hunter got to fly the Cessna four-seater plane **the entire time** (!!)

![takeoff from Lihue airport](../img/kauai25.jpg)

Here' we go!  (This _is_ the main Lihue airport, BTW.  Small, no? 8-)

![flying over kauai coast](../img/kauai26.jpg)

We fly clockwise around the entire island.

![tracey in plane back seat over coast](../img/kauai27.jpg)

I'm losing my mind -- I can't believe here we are vacationing, unbelievable views, AND HUNTER IS FLYING!

![napali coast from above](../img/kauai28.jpg)

Kauai's famous Napali Coast -- the NW corner of the island.  There are no roads here.  Only permitted-in-advance hikers can cross this.

![hanalei bay from above](../img/kauai29.jpg)

Overlooking the gorgeous small town and bay of Hanalei -- the NE corner of the island.

![hunter flying overlooking central mountains](../img/kauai30.jpg)

![kauai central mountain ridge](../img/kauai31.jpg)

The inner mountains of Kauai host, Mount Waialeale, the 8th wettest place in the world.
The 5000+ foot peak gets rain 300+ days of the year, averaging 500 inches (!)

![preparing to land plane](../img/kauai32.jpg)

Time to land, with some advice from the pilot.

![tracey & hunter at fantasy island falls](../img/kauai33.jpg)

We hit one of the most iconic falls in Kauai on the trip north -- TV show "Fantasy Island" made them famous!

![hunter & jeep on dirt road](../img/kauai34.jpg)

Some 4x4 shenanignas on the counter-clockwise trip to 2 nights in Princeville / Hanalei.

![tracey & hunter in jeep on dirt road](../img/kauai35.jpg)

This was **super** fun -- but it did shrink to a very narrow one-lane only and I had to backup ~1/4 mile when a group of locals came the other direction with a full pickup truck!

![overlooking hanalie valley](../img/kauai36.jpg)

The view overlooking the Hanalei valley.

![hunter relaxing at hanalei beach](../img/kauai37.jpg)

Chilling on the Hanalei beach -- a perfect bay surrounded by mountains, gorgeous clouds, warmth, and waves.  Beer and snacks is such a nice way to soak in the sunset.

![legs & snacks on hanalei beach](../img/kauai38.jpg)

## Day six

![tracey & hunter at beach](../img/kauai39.jpg)

We explore the northeast end of Kauai and enjoy some great food, the most dramatic evening lightning storm, and more off-roading on a beach -- plus more of that chill-out sunset experience.

There were two huge banks of long clouds off-shore.  The **attacked** each other with lightning bursts, every few seconds, much like 2 wooden ships in a cannon fight.  Everyone, including the staff, cleared the restaurant to watch in wonder..

## Day seven - do we have to go home?

![returning jeep](../img/kauai40.jpg)

Dropping our rental.
Such an amazing experience together.
This was the first of four jeep, jeep gladiator, or ford bronco rentals.
We finally
[buy a jeep](/2023/12/bought-a-jeep/)
after the Jeep Wrangler gets big upgrades (like Wireless Apple CarPlay, an 11" touchscreen, better seats and lots more), at the end of 2023.
