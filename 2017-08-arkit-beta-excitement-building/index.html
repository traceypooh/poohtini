I'm quite excited to have figured out so far how to:

  * update home machine to Sierra to run xCode 9 beta
  * start playing with xCode
  * borrow iPhone 7 with iOS 11 beta running on it
  * setup free provisioning for testing app
  * start with ARKit "hello world" type app demo from the amazing folks at Apple

ARKit possibilities areÂ _blowing me away_!

Now! Â On to hacking and trying out my app idea.... ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€
