Hunter and I really really liked this film shown on PBS this week. It nicely wanders in its storytelling and is really thoughtfullly done. John Adams (I think) said his best piece of lawyer-ing was defending the British in Boston after the Boston Massacre. The military officer who defended the Gitmo detainee here is a true American hero.
