Hunter and I did our very first AIDS LifeCycle charity ride, biking 545 miles in 7 days,
from SF to LA!
AIDS and HIV have devastated the world, killing over 20 million people worldwide.

The [San Francisco AIDS Foundation](https://sfaf.org)
has been my biggest charity for over 10 years.
I finally did their
[big fundraising bikeride](https://aidslifecycle.org)!

The weather was gorgeous for this first week of June 2008 and we had the ride of our life.
We trained up well enough by our tough and hilly weekly bikerides up in the Oakland hills
and managed to bike every single mile and avoid injury.

containing blog entries from training and the ride itself,
comments from my **amazing supporters**, and more.

Below are our "12 best" pictures from the ride, linking to a full photo album.

We just signed up to ride again in 2009!
