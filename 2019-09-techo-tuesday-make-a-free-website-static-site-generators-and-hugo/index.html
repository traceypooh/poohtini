_things turning me on this week_ <br/>
_â˜•enjoy with a hot cupa java/script_ <br/>
I'm now migrating off of WordPress and a paid web hosting plan,
to a free* website using **Hugo** and **GitLab**.
It nicely leverages **markdown** and makes posting content from an editor a breeze.
Your entire website is in a **git** repository -- so you can take your entire website anywhere and
have a full copy on your laptop (even with networking off).  **No database**!

For me, suddenly writing felt more like _writing_ again - and I get to have full copies of everything (with any luck, the site should last forever..)

## Static Site Generators

Basically, instead of a server-side scripting language-based website (like PHP or python) - these kind of websites have you writing basic HTML.  But versions like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), um, go, a step further.  They have you write in a _much more natural_ way, using [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

They _get cute_ by having a 'production' step that prepares your site and does some light transforms of your pages into a new `/public/` subdir (that your pages serve from), converting markdown to HTML (AKA markup).  It sums up your 'tags' and 'categories' and makes static simple pages based on them, eg: `/categories/coding/`.  It uses your "number of posts per page" variable to auto-paginate and make static simple pages like: `/page/2/` or `/tags/biking/page/2/`.

They _also_ can get clever about user comments - allowing Discus or 'staticman' as ways to get comments into your site and onto your pages.  I chose staticman because my code repository will get the comments (instead of being stored in some external service).

## Hugo

_huGO_ <br/>
Hugo is a _blisteringly_ fast alternative to Jekyll, based on the superfast (and quite new) `Go` language (more like `C` language in terms of speed, statically typed, and compiled).  My older brother suggested it after noting his similar blog of 10years+ of entries was taking _minutes_ to build in Jekyll - but seconds with Hugo.

## Setup Hugo
You can quickstart very.. quickly!  There's a bunch of themes you can pick from - I chose the one below.

## Deploy to the world

You can use GitLab or GitHub - I prefered GitLab because I use its build process at work and it has the quickest/easiest stup.  They want your business, and will host it for free.  You setup an account, and `git push` your laptop directory of files to them.  Everything re-deploys automatically ever time you `git push` an update - easy!

(*) _You can get your own hostname and point it to your GitLab (or GitHub) site url for a nicer URL, for about $20/year_
