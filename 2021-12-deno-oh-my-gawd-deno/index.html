_things turning me on this week_ <br/>
_‚òïenjoy with a hot cupa java/script_ <br/>
JavaScript is _mental_ now with `deno` --- forget `node` `npm` `package.json` `node_modules` and everything you growed up on.  This ü¶ï changes _everything!_

About a year ago, an amazing coworker who shall remain anonymous ([COUGH] Drini), casually mentioned ["Deno"](https://deno.land) in a team meeting (~12 of us).  They mentioned Ryan Dahl, the creator of `node`, created this as The Next Thing.  I'd never heard of it, checked it out, got excited and was... _deflated_ seeing _full urls_ in `import` statements (instead of relative urls) since that wasn't compatible with browsers.

When a tech idea & premise is _so good_ with a fatal flaw, I _tend_ to revisit periodically...

3 months ago, to my _amazement_ -- all the main browsers were totally loading full urls, eg:
```js
import $ from 'https://esm.sh/jquery'
```

"Cancel my appointments for the month!" --- I dove in _immediately_ to kick the tires on the back-end and see if _fully_ replacing `node` for `deno` in my work (mostly backend) main repository for TV, audio & video, containing 30,000+ JS lines, might work.

In under 3 months, I migrated the entire repository to Deno.

Here's a nice browser example:

https://av.archive.org/demo/deno.htm

Pay special attention to the top and later `import` statements here.

You can load logical `npm` modules directly from the web (!) üòç

Omitting (just) the pie chart setup clutter (it's a lot of JSON config for the data -- you can [see the full source here](https://av.archive.org/demo/deno.js)):

```js
import $ from 'https://esm.archive.org/jquery@^3.0.0'
import dayjs from 'https://esm.archive.org/dayjs'
import * as d3v7 from 'https://esm.archive.org/d3'

import { log } from '../js/util/log.js'

window.d3 = { version: '7.0.0', ...d3v7 }

$('body').append(`
  <style>.card { width: 40%; margin: 3%; display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; }</style>
  <div id="x" class="card card-body bg-light">
    <h1>bootstrap hai whirld</h1>
    no real idea why it's working to \`import\` with urls starting with 'https://' now!
    <p> working in (at least): chrome, safari, firefox, safari iOS</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-body bg-light">
    <p>.. that doesnt work in \`node\` for example.</p>
    <p>.. but natively works in \`deno\`!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-body bg-light">
    <h2>some dayjs stuff</h2>
    ${dayjs().format('dddd MMMM D, YYYY h:mma')}<br>
    ${dayjs().format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss')}<br>
    ${dayjs().startOf('month').add(1, 'day').set('year', 2018)
    .format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss')}<br>
  </div>
  <div class="card card-body bg-light">
    <h2>user privacy</h2>
    self-hosted
    <a href="https://esm.sh">esm.sh</a>
    -- at
    <a href="https://esm.archive.org">esm.archive.org</a>
    <pre>
import dayjs from 'https://esm.archive.org/dayjs'
import $ from 'https://esm.archive.org/jquery@^3.0.0'
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div id="pieChart"></div>
`)
$('#x h1').hide().fadeIn('slow')

async function dpie() {
  const d3pie = (await import('https://esm.archive.org/d3pie')).default

  const pie = new d3pie('pieChart', {
    ...
  })
}

void dpie()
```

Look how clean that is!

No need to `npm install` -- no need for `npm` or `node` whatsoever.

You can load JS from `npm` packages transpiled-on-the-fly to `import`-able JS via https://www.skypack.dev/, https://esm.sh (we host one of these on our archive.org site for user privacy), and more.

It's hard to fully articulate how weightless it feels to develop multiple repos, all without any kind of `npm install` or setup -- and just load JS files directly into the browser or backend.

You can now _make websites, blogs, and more_ entirely free, committed to and hosted at https://github.com or https://gitlab.com -- no backend needed.

Here's a fun example of charting Live Music concerts stored at https://archive.org that I live coded for
[Aaron Swartz Day 2021](https://www.aaronswartzday.org/asd-2021/)
where everything is hosted free at github:

[band recordings per year site](https://traceypooh.github.io/multi-line-chart/)

[band recordings per year source](https://github.com/traceypooh/multi-line-chart)

I'm shook!

(and won't go back)

[postscript]

BTW, it took a couple months to migrate, _not_ because migrating `node` => `deno` is _particularly_ involved or long.

The conversion took awhile because:
- major delay due to needing to find a minimal porting setup for code `lint`, test, and coverage.
Ultimately, though `deno lint` is good (and blazing fast) ---
at this point --- `eslint` is still better.
I also didn't want to change my `expectations` based ES Modules `mocha` test files too much.
My next Teco Tuesday post will be about a nice testing & coverage setup.
- I decided it was time to move all synchronous/blocking network and shell-out calls to async i/o
- I decided _not_ to use any of the available `node`-compatible layer -- and instead switch everything to _native_ `deno`.

(There's only 2 files presently using a single node-compatible emulation `readdir()` call, since I already had performant complex async i/o doing parallel processing with it, running live 24x7, that I didn't want to destabilize, eg:
```js
import { readdir } from 'https://deno.land/std/node/fs/promises.ts'
```
