## This is a <strong>50 mile ride</strong> that starts from Orinda (BART, east side parking lot) and climbs a bit over halfway up Mt. Diablo and then returns

We start in Orinda, then head east through the canyons (mostly flat) for about 15 miles.

We will stop here at Cafe Francaise in Danville for a short rest and any food riders wish to purchase. There is a water dispenser in their soda foutain and ice that we can use for bottles if need be.

After the rest, it then starts a slow incline to the entrance to Mt. Diablo State Park. We then climb to the halfway point. Combined, it's about 5 miles of climbing. There are only a few very short steep segments (very doable) but it is mostly a continuous but manageable grade **up**! So pace yourself and enjoy the views. Climbing this South Gate road is sheer bliss and Tracey's **favorite** climb. It was recently repaved so it is a smooth, well-graded ride nearly all the way up.

We top off at the ranger station where there are some views and some vista points nearby. There are full bathrooms here (below/behind the ranger station) and a running water fountain.

The descent is nearly 10 miles to get back to the mostly flat retracing through the canyons and back to Orinda.
