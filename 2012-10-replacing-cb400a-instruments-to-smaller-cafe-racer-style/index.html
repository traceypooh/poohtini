Today I did much more than I thought I would -- I pulled out and disconnected all instruments and relocated the ignition/key switch.

The plan is to combine the current speedometer/odometer with four of the seven indicator lights (neutral, high beam indicator, oil warning light, turn signal indicator) into a smaller chrome combined unit, and just plain omit the other three lights (parking brake, 1st gear, 2nd gear).

Now that I've done more than I had planned ("oh, maybe just two bolts today to see if I can figure out more what I'm up against...") it is time to order parts! ðŸ˜Ž
