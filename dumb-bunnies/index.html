## PoohBot Pictures

is the name for Tracey's video love and hobby outside of work.

I have an education and background in "machine vision" (teaching computers how to "see" and react to imagery like a human might). I found video and movies fascinating at an early age and that love continues to this day. I have about 100 short movies on [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/poohBot). As one of the main server engineers at archive.org, I get to spend part of my time on my great passion, and work on video processing and video displaying (eg: setting up flash players to play h.264 video). I recently rebuilt our over 200,000 videos hosted on the archive.org site in part for the release of Firefox 3.1. I also coincidentally work and compare notes with a brilliant coder named Raj who was one of the main engineers of h.264 video in Apple's Quicktime group. Yay video!

I have previously done some VCD and DVD mastering and authoring, as well as video processing and encoding for others. I even got a credit on my brother's first feature-length film, [Stolen Good](http://rjfilms.com).

I previously used the name Dumb Bunny Productions, before it became PoohBot Pictures.

My sister is a graphic artist and created a logo and design and gave the family shirts for Christmas.

Hunter and I wore our shirts on AIDS LifeCycle 7.

My brother Russ is another jersey owner and wearer who has biked around the East Bay while wearing it, too ðŸ˜Ž
