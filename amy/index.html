  <div>
  My boss, Brewster Kahle, knew that I am a raving fan of Amy Goodman and her
  amazing show of independent journalism.  He was kind enough
  to invite me along to a <b>long breakfast discussion with Amy</b>.  They found a
  common interest on issues of the potential monopoly of Google books,
  so she scheduled a followup discussion the next day with Brewster on Amy's show
  "<a href="http://www.democracynow.org">Democracy Now!</a>"
  (for likely broadcasting Apr20-25).
  In person, Amy is an incredibly sweet and inquisitive individual.
  She is brilliant as well as thoughtful, generous and full of grace.
  I was thrilled to meet her in person and see how a part of her day goes.
  I look up to her tremendously as an
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman#Recognition">award-winning</a>
  pioneer in the field of journalism.
