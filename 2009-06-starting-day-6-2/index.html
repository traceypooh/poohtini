So far so good.
We made it safe and dry until now.
Today started light rain with wet tent.
It's let up over breakfast mostly so we are hoping hoping for a break today and crossing our fingers.

Today's highlights are Santa Barbara,
hopefully dolphin coastal sightings,
and an ice cream stop -- it's normally super hot today!

Yesterday's day 5 "red dress day" was a blast even though it was a bit of a hard finish with hills and headwinds.

Thanks all for your support, interest, and comments!
