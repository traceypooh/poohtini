Lost & Found 100 mile gravel race - I won my age group, women's 50 years (and up)!

This is the longest gravel bike that I've ever done!  Perfect conditions & feeling in good shape had me upgrade from 60mi to 100mi the night before!  I was super efficient at stops and just kept going.  I thought I might not make time cutoffs, but wound up winning with the 3 women 50 and over who made the entire 100 miles.  Drew from our crew won the *entire* 35 mile race!!

The EBGB Crew (East Bay Gravel Bikers) for the race, Drew, Trevor, Michael, Jana, Hunter, Tracey.  We camped for 2 nights and ate dinner at nearby Frank Lloyd Wright building together.

From the campground - Off to the races!  For fun we rented a Ford Bronco for the weekend.

I'm the only in the squad doing the 100 mile option, so I'm leaving an hour early.

Giddy at the start!  😻
Last year, here, was my first bike race ever -- but this year I'm doing the 100 mile monster.

Gravel & dirt country roads for days.  Elevation (~6000' average) is always a bit challenging for me, and I didn't sleep much the night before.  But I got two good nights sleep before that so I'm ready to go get 'em.

Farms, barns, and even abandoned buildings watch us cruise by.

OK, I've just left the *critical* rest stop with a time cutoff that was going to be close.  I left it 20 minutes before cutoff.  I've now done the math of the climbs and miles ahead.  I should easily make the final rest stop & cutoff -- and should finish the entire race.  I'm *delighted*!

An utterly delightful 45 minutes of deep back-road double-lane roads winding up and down through hills & trees.

5th of 6th rest stop.  Due to many issues(*), this is the first real food I've had all race, 77 miles in.  I've started to cry and have told multiple volunteers I love them.  I do 2-3 shooters of peanut butter pretzels, full coke, pickle, and just-off-the-griddle bacon.

(* Shimano truck got stuck for 1 rest stop.  The rest got mostly "looted" by the large number of riders in the 3 different races by time I got there.  Very glad I packed a lot of food with me in my pockets).

Final descent back to tarmac -- and then a 9-mile dash back to the finish.
I'll have done 70 of 100 miles on dirt & gravel!

At the finish!  Longest off-road bike ride of my life!  I'm blown away to find out I finish first in my age group, age 50 and up!

Woohoo!  9-1/2 hours, start to finish - 8-1/2 hours moving.  Minimal quick stops at every rest stop esp. for fluids.   4 chain derailments & 1 fast bike mechanic clean & re-lube.

Winner's medal, jersey and very cool coffee mug.  Race plate and my typical handlebar rolled & taped "cheat sheet" showing me the climbs and rest stops.  (I tend to not ride or race with a computer (!) and just use my watch and rely on race turn signage or following herds ;-)

Heading home -- but not before a little *drop dead gorgeous* dirt road exploring with the topless Brazonco.
