Two week vacation to the glorious island of Bali, summer 2010.

Bali is culturally fascinating -- full of very happy and cooperative people unlike any place I've seen. Here are some interesting tidbits/observances:

Bali is an amazing isolated place whose people typically lives communally and is based off of the agriculture of rice. Despite being part of Islamic Indonesia, the vast majority (70%+) of the people are Hindu (with a mix of Animism from Bali's indigenous roots).

We saw everything we could, ate their amazing food, and tried to soak up as much Balinese culture as we could!
