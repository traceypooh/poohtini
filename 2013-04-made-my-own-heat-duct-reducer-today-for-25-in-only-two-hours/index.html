Using a 24" x 36" sheet of (intended for ducting) sheet metal (~$10) and rivet tool + rivets (~$15) I was able to take a 14" x 8" opening and create a 4" deep reducer down to a 14" x 4" opening.

This way, this can be an **insert** into an existing duct and "boot"/box that takes an 8" pipe of heat into a 4" deep 14" x 8" box.  It can then exhale the heat into a 14" x 4" vent.

Why the insert you ask?  Hint: house was built in 1960.  Guess what the most common way to insulate ductwork **and** boxes/registers/boots was back then?   ASBESTOS, YAY!

So while we don't know it is for sure, it sure looks like it (inspectors clued us in, t00).   So we not gonna mess w/ the box/ductwork that is in relatively good shape and not cut it, etc.

This is all part of a Bigger Project of redecoration we are doing at the bunny fort.
