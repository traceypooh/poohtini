We bike the entire "Outer Cape", 60 miles, going for the dirtiest paths (and least cars) possible. 😻

Proud of my twin! He doesn't bike that often, and has a recurring right knee issue from decades old snowboarding injury. So we took it slow (party pace) with a lot of stops and had a great day together 🥰

Cape Cod towns: Eastham, Welfleet, Truro, Provincetown

Can you feel the Cape Cod vibes? 🏝️
