**THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU** donors to my AIDS LifeCycle8 bikeride!<br/>
I took about 500 photos myself during the seven days of riding. Hunter also took about that many photos, too. I will make a combined album soon and edit a video as well and put links to them on this site.

However, for now, you can see Â 
**~100 of my best photos** on my public albums here:
