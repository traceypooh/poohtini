Today Hunter helped me inspect, test-drive, buy, and drive 100+ miles home from a mom-n-pop custom bike modifier in California's central valley.

We avoided the 5 and all freeways and started out with about an hour of "country roads" and farm roads that were mostly straight and flat. Next we nearly ran out of gas but recovered thanks to the "reserve switch" to fillup in Tracy. Finally, we started the fun curvy and up-and-down stuff through the northwest backside of Mt. Diablo and had a late lunch in Clayton. We wrapped it up through Moraga, and then our favorite twisty mountain pass up Pinehurst to Skyline Blvd and home

What an wild day!

I've named her "decaf" since she's an automatic (with just "lo" and "hi" gears, no clutch) **and** a cafe racer style modified bike. I'm really pleased she did so well on the first ambitious ride all the way home.

Here's some bike porn / pix!
