Hunter and I got to
[hear Naomi Wolf speak](http://www.globalexchange.org/getInvolved/bayarea.php?uid=8230)
about her new book, along with
**Daniel Ellsberg (pictured left)**, the leaker of the "Pentagon Papers" (which helped
end the Vietnam War).

The event was sponsored by KPFA and featured a moderator and another journalist.

All parties agreed we need to
[impeach Cheney](http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/28427)
[impeach Cheney](http://wexlerwantshearings.com)
ASAP!

**Torture is illegal** under domestic and international laws, and the Geneva Convention. **Warantless wiretapping is illegal**. For these two reasons alone (but many more), Cheney should be impeached and tried for high crimes and misdemeanors!

Take action [now!](http://www.democrats.com/topelosiandjudiciary)

From [The End of America -- Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot](http://www.chelseagreen.com/2007/items/endofamerica):

Ten Steps to dictatorship -- happening now in America:

  1. Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy.
  2. Create secret prisons where torture takes place.
  3. Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens.
  4. Set up an internal surveillance system.
  5. Harass citizens' groups.
  6. Engage in arbitrary detention and release.
  7. Target key individuals.
  8. Control the press.
  9. Declare all dissent to be treason.
 10. Suspend the rule of law.
