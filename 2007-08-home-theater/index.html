... on a _twelve foot diagonal screen_, muhahaahaaaa!

Russ found a government auction site that disposes of lots of surplus and other equipment.

I picked up two **geenormous** **BARCO LCD rear projector**s for only $75, plus my own shipping and handling by showing up to a "high alert" and checkpointed military base just outside of Sacramento.

It tooks us many months to finally get around to mounting it, seeing if it even would work for us, and converging it.

But when we did -- **wow!** The one we use displays HD signals (we bought 3 professional-grade BNC cables and connectors for the receiver-to-projector connection for under $50).

Both our TV box and DVD player line double a progressive signal.

I think we may have the best looking home theater that I've seen -- not bad for 10 year old equipment, eh? ðŸ˜Ž
