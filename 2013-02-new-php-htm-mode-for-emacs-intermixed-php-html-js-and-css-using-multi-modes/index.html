I finally formalized, cleaned up, and packaged up my current emacs editing setup for files with intermixed PHP, HTML, JS/javascript, and CSS code all in the same file.  It uses an existing but rarely used technique called "multi-mode" and sets "trigger points" for switching the "major mode" of the buffer as your cursor moves through the code.

A nice thing about this approach is that you can always glance down anytime you are editing to see which mode you are in (or the emacs lisp code **thinks** you are in).  You can also fork/edit the single ".el" lisp file to add/update the triggers for various modes.
