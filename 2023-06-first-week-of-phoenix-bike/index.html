Brand new bike!  After trying Hunter's [Trek SuperCaliber 9.8 XT](https://www.trekbikes.com/ca/en_CA/bikes/mountain-bikes/cross-country-mountain-bikes/supercaliber/supercaliber-9-8-xt/p/35146) ultra-light XC ("cross country") racer bike for a week -- I was hooked.  Once I saw this color scheme, and the 20% off sale for this 2022 bike -- I secretely ordered it.  It's an absolutely amazing bike.  It _wants_ you to push hard, to tear into a climb or bounce down a descent.

She's named "Phoenix" after the X-Men superheroine, being a "supercaliber" bike from Trek in the sunburst/fireball colors of the Phoenix :)

The (Shimano XT) brakes are *bananas* great.  The stock gears are *perfection*.  The (mechanical -- my preference still) shifting is supersmooth and the best I've ever had on a bike.  I'm in love!

At a hard-to-believe 24 pountds -- it's only 4 pounds more than my gravel bike.  It's got 100mm of front fork travel, and 60mm in the rear (using this unique "inline" shock under the top tube).

My first group ride ("Thirsty Thursday" with EBGB).  I didn't tell anyone I bought this until I showed up :D

My first weekend with Phoenix -- naturally wanted to go to my favorite Bay Area loop.  It starts by climbing Mt. Tamalpais, then super fun and weirdly technical "Coastal Trail" down to Muir Beach.  Then up Diaz Ridge and Miwok Trail over to the main ridge, and back down to Muir Beach.  Final climb up Middle Green Gulch.  Fun long descent to Tennessee Beach, and end the trip with "The Junction" beer garden.

Heading down steep trails to Muir Beach -- it did *absolutely amazing* work of the gravel bike anxiety trails!
