My new [gravel bike](/tags/gravel-bike/) Trek Boone 6 got upgraded today with 25% wider tires, and from tubed to tublesss.  So that moves me from the stock 32c (mm width) tires to 40c.

The larger tires allow me to absorb bigger bumps, holes, rocks and shocks.

The tubeless part allows me to roll with lower PSI for an _even more_ shock-absorbing ride.

I'm super happy with the upgrades and did a couple miles offroad today in our typical morning 10 mile course around our hills.  I managed to ride the fastest and most confidently on the same segments I've done nearly 20 times now since owning the bike.

Coming later this week, we're migrating the gears to more capable uphill climbers:
- 11-34T (rear) x 40T front (now)
- 11-46T (rear) x 36T front (new!)

That should complete her makeover from a "cyclocross" bike to a legit gravel bike.

I signed up for a gravel "race" in Tahoe with Hunter in a couple weeks -- so the timing is perfect.

Oh, and also.

Finally after a bunch of honorable mentions, for a couple months, trying to find her voice, she's got her name.

She's _that girl_ who shows up to the party with lipstick a shade too tawdry, yet manages to be the life of the party.

Tracey loves _Candy_ üíñ
