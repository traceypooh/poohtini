This ride is our easiest of our five, but prolly the most surreal.

- **OIL**: we ride through the belly of the beast -- literally.
  There are public roads that we bike on that snake through some of the refinery pipelines
  and you can even see black dirt (ewww!)
- **SUGAR**: we ride ride up to the C&H Sugar factory and shipping area and buildings.
  It's right near the pretty overlook of the Carquinez bridge and bay
- **BEEF**: to balance it all out, we return to sanity and ride through some crazy pretty
  farms and wide open farmlands complete with moo moos!

The first half of the ride is near the bay where the weather is a little more "bay like";
whereas the second half is more of the typically warmer inland valley climates.
